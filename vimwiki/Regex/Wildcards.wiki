Wildcards in regex tend to follow the capitalization-negation convention:

\w == Any set of alphanumeric characters [124gavry6nASDB]
\W == Any NON-alphanumeric characters [ @#$	;']

# (combined) ranges:
[A-Z] == all capital letters
[A-Za-z] == all letters

\d == any digit
\D == NOT a digit

\s == whitespace
\S == NOT whitespace

| ?     | zero or one   of whatever precedes it |
| *     | zero or more  of whatever precedes it |
| +     | one  or more  of whatever precedes it |
| {n}   | exactly n times                       |
| {n,m} | n to m times                          |
| {n,}  | n or more times                       |
| {,m}  | m or fewer times                      |
|       |                                       |

Examples:

Quantifier	Legend	Example	Sample Match
+	One or more	Version \w-\w+	Version A-b1_1
{3}	Exactly three times	\D{3}	ABC
{2,4}	Two to four times	\d{2,4}	156
{3,}	Three or more times	\w{3,}	regex_tutorial
*	Zero or more times	A*B*C*	AAACC
?	Once or none	plurals?	plural

For multiple characters in series, see [[Regex_Quantifiers]]
e.g.  X* is for character X repeated arbitrarily many times (including zero) --thus .* is the wildcard for any string.
