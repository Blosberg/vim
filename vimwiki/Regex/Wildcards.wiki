Wildcards in regex tend to follow the capitalization-negation convention:

\w == Any set of alphanumeric characters [124gavry6nASDB]
\W == Any NON-alphanumeric characters [ @#$	;']

# (combined) ranges:
[A-Z] == all capital letters
[A-Za-z] == all letters

\d == any digit
\D == NOT a digit

\s == whitespace
\S == NOT whitespace

.  == Any character _at all_ 



For multiple characters in series, see [[Regex_Quantifiers]]
e.g.  X* is for character X repeated arbitrarily many times (including zero) --thus .* is the wildcard for any string.
