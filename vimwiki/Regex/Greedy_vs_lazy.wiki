'Greedy' means match longest possible string.
'Lazy' means match shortest possible string.

For example, the greedy h.+l matches 'hell' in 'hello' but the lazy h.+?l matches 'hel'. More examples:


Quant	Legend				Example	Sample Match
+	The + (one or more) is "greedy"	\d+	12345
?	Makes quantifiers "lazy"	\d+?	1 in 12345
*	The * (zero or more) is "greedy"	A*	AAA
?	Makes quantifiers "lazy"	A*?	empty in AAA
{2,4}	Two to four times, "greedy"	\w{2,4}	abcd
?	Makes quantifiers "lazy"	\w{2,4}?	ab in abcd


Example: (not sure why this works):
s/^.*{PATHIN}//        <--- Greedy
:s/^.\{-}{PATHIN}//    <--- Lazy
