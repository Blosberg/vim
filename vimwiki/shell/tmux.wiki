tmux wiki notes:

= Copy-pasting =

Hold Shift to circumvent tmux's mouse handling --then highlight, and ctrl+shift+c/v to copy paste

= Sessions =
tmux new -s myname
(from within): new<CR>  new session
s  list sessions
$  (re)name session


From within tmux

Short way: prefix, then dollar sign:

Ctrl + B, $

= Change directory  =
# Detach from a session and then reattach to it with the "c" option specifying new starting directory:

tmux attach-session -t tmuxwtfbbq -c /home/chuck/new_default_directory

= Windows (tabs) =
c  create window
w  list windows
n  next window
p  previous window
f  find window
,  name window
&  kill window

== Move windows  ==

swap-window

"Prefix :" (that is Ctrl+B, : by default) brings you to the tmux-command prompt. There you enter:

swap-window -s 3 -t 1

to let window number 3 and window number 1 swap their positions.

To swap the current window with the top window, do:

swap-window -t 0

In the unlikely case of having no window at index 0, do:

move-window -t 0


= Panes (splits) =
%  vertical split
"  horizontal split
: resize-pane -[U/D/L/R]  N
o  swap panes
q  show pane numbers
x  kill pane
+  break pane into window (e.g. to select text by mouse to copy)
-  restore pane from window
‚çΩ  space - toggle between layouts
<prefix> q (Show pane numbers, when the numbers show up type the key to goto that pane)
<prefix> { (Move the current pane left)
<prefix> } (Move the current pane right)
<prefix> z toggle pane zoom
