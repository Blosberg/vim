-n Option : To sort a file numerically used –n option

-g like -n but handles scientific notation
e.g.
sort -k4g,4g fin > fout

( Use -g (long form --general-numeric-sort) instead of -n. The -g option passes the numbers through strtod to obtain their value, and it will recognize this format.  )

-r Option: Sorting In Reverse Order (i.e. descending)

-nr (both above)

-k Option : Unix provides the feature of sorting a table on the basis of any column number by using -k option.
Use the -k option to sort on a certain column. For example, use “-k 2” to sort on the second column

	A key specification like -k2 means to take all the fields from 2 to the end of the line into account. So Villamor 44 ends up before Villamor 50.
        To sort by a single column, use -k2,2 as the key specification. This means to use the fields from #2 to #2, i.e. only the second field.
sort -kx,y -k5n,5
      # ^ sort from col x to col y; numeric flags as needed

-c option : This option is used to check if the file given is already sorted or not & checks if a file is already sorted pass the -c option to sort. This will write to standard output if there are lines that are out of order.

-u option : To sort and remove duplicates pass the -u option to sort.

-M Option : To sort by month pass the -M option to sort.
