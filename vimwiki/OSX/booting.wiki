Holding command-R is a good trick on bootup to access boot options.

to reset NVRAM:

Shut down your Mac. Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. Turn on your Mac. Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound. Hold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time. Release the keys.


for the 2008 MB, holding option (alt) is the way to choose the boot menu, before RefInd even kicks in
