Create your own profile from a manifest like this:
/gnu/remote/bin/guixr package -p [target_dir]/.guix-profile -m manifest.scm
+ Example of what a [[manifest]] file should look like.

install a specific package:
$/gnu/remote/bin/guixr package -i snakemake
$/gnu/remote/bin/guixr package -i bowtie

list all packages available on guix:
$/gnu/remote/bin/guixr package -A  [string to search for]

Create your own profile like this
 /gnu/remote/bin/guixr environment -r $HOME/guix_profiles/ChIPseq/.guix-profile -l guix.scm
or like this:

Add packages to this profile:
/gnu/remote/bin/guixr  package -p [target_profile]  --install [desired_package]

List the currently available packages on your profile:
guix package -p $GUIX_PROFILE/ -I

List the recent changes made to your profile:
guix package -p $GUIX_PROFILE/ -l

if you have locale issues:
add "glibc-locales" to my manifest file, then re-package, and then do `$export GUIX_LOCPATH=$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale`, and then these warnings will go away

load a "pure" environment from a scheme file (and leave out everything else)
$/gnu/remote/bin/guixr   environment --pure -l guix.scm

Re-enter this profile like this:
$ bash # to go into a sub shell so that env variables only get defined within the scope of that shell
$ source  ~/guix_profiles/ChIPseq/.guix-profile/etc/profile # this adds env variables to your current environment 
# it evaluates the contents of this file
(you can also use "." for source


Here is an example manifest:


(define packages (list "vim"
                       "neovim"
                       "git"
                       "gdb"
                       "tree"
                       "snakemake"
                       "nss-certs"
                       "r-minimal"
                       "glibc-locales"
                       "r-colorout"
))
