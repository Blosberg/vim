# First, find out the location of your drive (in this e.g. lets say it's sda2)
# 
# mount a drive to a given folder (provided that folder already exists):
sudo mount -t auto -o rw /dev/sda2 /media/old_HD_internal

# then add write permissions:
sudo mount -o remount,rw  /dev/sda2 /media/old_HD_internal

# unmount:
sudo umount /dev/sda2
