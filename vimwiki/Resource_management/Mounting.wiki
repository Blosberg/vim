# First, find out the location of your drive
$ lsblk

# (in this e.g. lets say it's sda2)
# 
# mount a drive to a given folder (provided that folder already exists):
sudo mount -t auto -o rw /dev/sda2 /media/old_HD_internal

# then add write permissions:
sudo mount -o remount,rw  /dev/sda2 /media/old_HD_internal

# unmount:
sudo umount /dev/sda2

For HFS file systems, you need to disable journaling from a mac to allow ubuntu to write to it (otherwise it's read-only for ubuntu):
$ sudo diskutil disableJournal

= FAT32 =

to get your uid and gid values:
`$` id -u ${USER}
1000
`$` id -g ${USER}
1000
# using these values:
`$` sudo   mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/boon/SSD2_FAT32/ -o rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
