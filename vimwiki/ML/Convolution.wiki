Convolutional layers preserve relationships between neighbourhoods of pixels.
They establish translational invariance to your network


Starting with a 4x4 input:
 ___________________          And a 3x3 filter:     We get an output
| 2  | 0  | 1  | 1  |         ______________        of products:
|----+----|----+----|        |  1 |  0 |  1 |         _________
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |        |----+----|----+        |  3 |  2 |
|----+----+----+----|   x    |  0 |  0 |  0 |  -->   |----+----|
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |        |----+----+----+        |  3 |  1 |
|----+----+----+----|        |  0 |  1 |  0 |        +----+----+
|  0 |  3 |  0 |  0 |        +----+----+----+
+-------------------+

                             ^ The weights to this filter then define local
                             relationships (shapes, structures) etc. that can
                             be learned at a low level. Take higher order from
                             there.
