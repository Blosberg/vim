Max pooling is a sample-based discretization process. The objective is to
down-sample an input representation (image, hidden-layer output matrix, etc.),
reducing its dimensionality and allowing for assumptions to be made about
features contained in the sub-regions binned.

Max pooling is done by applying a max filter to (usually) non-overlapping
subregions of the initial representation.
