The Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure (FDR)


Step 1: Conduct all of your statistical tests and find the p-value for each test.

Step 2: Arrange the p-values in order from smallest to largest, assigning a rank to each one â€“ the smallest p-value has a rank of 1, the next smallest has a rank of 2, etc.

Step 3: Calculate the Benjamini-Hochberg critical value for each p-value, using the formula (i/m)*Q
where:
i = rank of p-value
m = total number of tests
Q = your chosen false discovery rate

Step 4: Find the largest p-value that is less than the critical value. Designate every p-value that is smaller than this p-value to be significant.

(e.g. suppose p-values are in the 5th col)
( cat -n adds the line numbers, sed -n '2,p'

sed -n '2,$p' $file_in \
   | sort -n -k 5 \
   | cat -n  \
   | awk -v Qthresh=$Qthresh -v M=$M '{print $2, $3, $6, $7, $1*Qthresh/M, $6<$1*Qthresh/M }' > output
