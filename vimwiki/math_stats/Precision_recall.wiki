= Precision: =
[ True positive ] /( [True Positive] + [False positive] )
  --> Of what you declared to be True, how precise were you in getting the right ones
     --> How good were you in getting *ONLY* what you wanted
  
= Recall: =
[ True positive ] /( [True Positive] + [False Negative] )
  --> What fraction of the Actual positives did you recover (recall) in your declared True Positives
     --> How good were you at getting *ALL* of what you wanted.
