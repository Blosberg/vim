Tags are Shorthand to refer to some important point in development

# Add a lightweight tag:
git tag <tagname>  [SHA]

# Add an annotated tag:
git tag -a v1.1 -m "version 1.0" [SHA]

# list tags
git tag [--list | (-l)]
git tag -l "v2*"  # <-- regex
-n (see annotation lines default just one)

# work with them just like SHAs from there.
# e.g. git diff v1.0..v1.1

# delete
git tag -d tagname

= Remotes =

tags are fetched by default, but does not push by default. must be pushed explicitly

git push origin v1.1   
git push origin --tags # push _all_ tags

# delete remote tags like remote branches
