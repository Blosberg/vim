= unstaging =

The easiest way to unstage files on Git is to use the “git reset” command and specify the file you want to unstage.

git reset <commit> -- <path>

By default, the commit parameter is optional : if you don’t specify it, it will be referring to HEAD.

This command will reset the index entries (the ones you added to your staging area) to their state at the specified commit (or HEAD if you didn’t specify any commits).


= Interactive Staging =
# See also interactive rebasing in [[commit_tree#interactive|commit_tree]]

# stage interactively, and can lead to patch more where you select only certain lines:
git add [--interactive | -i]

(u)pdate -- adds files
(r)evert -- undoes this

(p)atch mode -- brings up selected changed files
        Select the one you want by number, then hit enter AGAIN 
        
        Now you can stage the edits in this file by HUNK

        Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,j,J,g,/,e,?]?
       
        ? -- gives you a help list defining these commands, e.g.:
        s - split a hunk by lines
        e - edit a hunk with +/- lines for staging
        ... etc.

# p-option also applied to other procedures...
git add [ -p | --patch ]
git stash -p
git reset [[-p]]
git checkout -p
git commit -p
