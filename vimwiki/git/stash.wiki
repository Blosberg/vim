# git help stash
# Stash, by default, does not stash untracked changes.
# -u is the option for including untracked

git stash save "<name>"  # sends current (unstaged) changes to tracked files to stash 
git stash show -p stash{0}

git stash pop            # pops a stash out of the list (by default the  most recent in position stash@{0})
apply                    # "" same as above but keep the stash stack. 
drop                     # drop an item from the stash stack
clear                    # clear the entire stash stack
