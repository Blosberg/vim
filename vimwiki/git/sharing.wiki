# replace your local version with whats on the remote
$ git fetch
$ git reset --hard [host]/[branch]

# replace remote version with your local version
$ git push --force (-f)

git push -u makes a tracking branch, so you will have

1) a branch on the remote
2) a snapshot of the remote branch (remote tracking branch)
3) a locally saved branch

"fetch" updates 2 and keeps them on your machine.

# delete local branch (3)
git branch -d

# delete remote branch (1)
# If you do this it will automatically delete (2)
git push --delete origin branchname
git push -d       origin branchname
git push origin         :branchname
#                    ^[nothing]            

# manually delete (2) if someone else deleted (1):
git remote prune origin
