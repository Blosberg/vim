 = open files  = 


Open/close:

e.g. File: ~/.vimrc

With the cursor on that filename, type:

gf       To open the file in a new buffer 
<C-W>f   To open the file in a horizontal split. 
<C-W>gf  To open the file in a new tab

--in principle <C-W><C-F> is supposed to open the file in a vertical split, but I haven't found that works. ... dunno why, maybe post the answer to that here later.

While in insert mode, when typing the name of a file, type <C-X><C-F> to open a list of ins-completions: 
<C-Y> selects the highlighted option
