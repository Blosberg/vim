= Most basic command: =

:Git <Whatever you would write in the command line>
e.g. 
:Gite checkout %            --> Gread  (empties the buffer and loads from most recent commit.)
:Git add %                  --> Gwrite
:Git mv  % target path      --> Gmove target_path
#        ^ current buffer

:Git commit -m "message"

:Gremove --> wipes out the buffer and stages removal of file.

:Gstatus brings up a menu of what's been changed
"-" adds things to staging
ctrl n/p navigates
<Enter> opens it
