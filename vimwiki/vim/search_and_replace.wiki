given this file:

fooVal1Bar;

fooVal^2Bar;

fooVal3Bar;


running this command in vim 
:%s/foo\(\w\+\)Bar/& = \1 + \1\Old/  

produces this:

fooVal1Bar = Val1 + Val1Old;

fooVal2Bar = Val2 + Val2Old;

fooVal3Bar = Val3 + Val3Old;


 ^ % == range of operation (whole file = equivalent to 1,$
  ^s/x/y/  == search for x, replace it with y:
  
the \w there is a regex wildcard (see  [[Wildcards]] wiki link)
