:tabedit file2

will open a new tab and take you to edit file2
To navigate between these tabs, you can be in normal mode and type

# forward
:gt

or

# backwards:
:gT

# Rearrange tabs:

You can use :tabmove followed by the tab number to move past. For example,
:tabmove 3 will make the current tab move past the 3rd. :tabmove 0 moves to the
beginning and :tabmove (without a number) moves to the end.
