    1       Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
            character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
            replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
            character defined in 'listchars' is used (default is a
            space).
            It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
    2       Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
            custom replacement character defined (see
            |:syn-cchar|).
    3       Concealed text is completely hidden.
