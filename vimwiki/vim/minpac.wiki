Commands

Minpac doesn't provide any commands. Use the :call command to call minpac functions. E.g.:

" To install or update plugins:
call minpac#update()

" To uninstall unused plugins:
call minpac#clean()

" To see plugins status:
call minpac#status()

== Start vs opt ==
All plugins will be installed under the following directories:

"start" plugins: <dir>/pack/<package_name>/start/<plugin_name>
"opt" plugins:   <dir>/pack/<package_name>/opt/<plugin_name>

"start" plugins will be automatically loaded after processing your .vimrc, or you can load them explicitly using :packloadall command. "opt" plugins can be loaded with :packadd command. See :help packages for detail.

:packadd {name}
