import pandas as pd
# Identify data type:
type(var)

# In pandas create 1-D arrays (series) like lists

= Series =
S = pd.Series( [1,2,3],
               index=["a","b","c"])
# You can then index, slice, etc. the same way as lists.
S.loc["a":"c"]
S.iloc[0:2]

   = processing data: counts, sorting, etc. =
# check frequencies of occurance of each index
S.value_counts()

# sort
S.sort_values( inplace = False )

# str. attributes are available to every Series
S.str.[contains/startswith/isnumeric]()

= Data Frames =
There is a [[numpy]] array inside every data frame.
Access it with .values
Alternative access:

# get dimensions with:
df.shape

# get first, last n lines
df.head(n), df.tail(n)

   = build a data frame from Series =
To create data frames from series, you can combine series, and pandas will match the keys up for you:

>>> X=pd.Series([1,2,3,4], index=["a","b","c","d"])
>>> Y=pd.Series([5,6,7,8], index=["a","c","d","e"])
>>> df=pd.DataFrame({"First":X,"Second":Y})
>>> df
   First  Second
a    1.0     5.0
b    2.0     NaN
c    3.0     6.0
d    4.0     7.0
e    NaN     8.0
# Note the missing fields in b, and e

   = Access columns =
df["First"] or df.First
# Latter only works if the col name has no spaces.

# Access multiple cols by creating a list [ , ]
# within the dereferencing braces -hence, double braces
`df[["First","Second"]]`
df.index    # to get list a-f

   = Access rows (+boolean select)=
df.loc["b"]  # gets rows (or columns) from labels.
df.iloc[2]   # gets rows (or columns) at positions (only takes integers).
df.ix[2,3]        # First tries to be like loc, but if it fails,
            # it then falls back to iloc

df.iloc[[0],[1]]
df.ix[0:2,0:5]
# N.B. ix will first try to match index explicitly (so if your indexes are
# named 0,1,2, then this will include all three rows.) but if your indexes
# have a different name (e.g. "first","second","third") then it wil
# automatically switch to integer indexing and will not include the last
# value (i.e. 0:2 = [0,1])

= Boolean indexing =
AND : &
OR  : |
NOT : ~

df[(df.First <3.5) & (df.Fourth > 4 )]
# also: df.colname.str.contains("substring")-->bool

= Sort =
# sort by multiple hierarchical criteria:
df.sort_values( by=["most-important col",
                   "Second-most-important col",
                    ...],
               ascending = True [default] )
