phonebook = {"John" : 938477566,"Jack" : 938377264,"Jill" : 947662781}
for name, number in phonebook.items():
    print("Phone number of %s is %d" % (name, number))
    

phonebook.pop("John")
does the same thing as 
del phonebook["John"]

# It may also be useful to load data structures from strings with 
json.loads(json_string)
# if the parentheses are part of the whole string, like, e.g.:
# "{ "key":val,"key2":val2...}"
