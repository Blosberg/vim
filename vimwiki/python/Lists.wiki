LISTS

list indexing list[start:stop:stride]
# a in reverse order
a[::-1] 

L0=[1,2,3]
L1=L0
# ^ Just creates another pointer to the same position in memory. If you want another list (i.e. copy by value), then:
L2=L0.copy()
# or:
L3=L0[:]
# or
L4=list(L0)

# List comprehension:
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]

e.g. list the even numbers between 5 and 9 in a string:

>>> [ "Here is charnum "+str(i)+" in a string " for i in range(5,9) if i%2==0 ]
['Here is charnum 6 in a string ', 'Here is charnum 8 in a string ']

multiple lists:

>>> [ "Here is charnum "+str(i)+" and "+ str(x) +" in a string " for i in range(5,9) for x in range(2,6) if i%2==0 and x%2==1 ]
['Here is charnum 6 and 3 in a string ', 'Here is charnum 6 and 5 in a string ', 'Here is charnum 8 and 3 in a string ', 'Here is charnum 8 and 5 in a string ']
