= Mode options open(filepath, mode='r') =

mode=one of ‘r’ / ‘w’ / ‘x’ / ‘a’+‘+’ or nothing+‘b’ or nothing

base 	r 	open for reading (default option), seek to the beginning of the file
        w 	open for writing, delete existing content
        x 	open for writing, fail if file exists
        a 	open for writing, seek to the end of the file
optional
        R+W 	+ 	open for read+write; otherwise as above
optional binary
        b 	binary mode (instead of text mode); otherwise as above
= Notes: =

    f.read() sets the read position after the byte last read.
    f.read() sets the write position to the end of the file in Python 3. [test]
    f.write() sets the read and write position to the end of the written content.
    f.seek() sets both the read and write positions.


The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt'). Modes 'w+' and 'w+b' open and truncate the file. Modes 'r+' and 'r+b' open the file with no truncation.
