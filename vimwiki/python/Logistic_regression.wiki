Logistic regression: Linear model that models
probabilities on a nonlinear scale

basic logistic formula:
log(   p(x)/( 1-p(x) )  ) = beta_0 + beta_1 * x_1 + ... + beta_p*x_p
#  ^ logit function


 x1 x2 x3 ...

# construct test data as in
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y,
                                                     train_size = 0.5,
                                                     random_state=1)
clf.fit( X_train, y_train )
clf.score(X_test, y_test)

# get probabilities for each class for each test point:
# and predict which class:
clf.predict[_proba]( X_test )
